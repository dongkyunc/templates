Hi ISP,

Thank you for the report. We believe this is a false positive.

The host in question runs Debian stable ("stretch") and has installed
the apache2 package at version {version}.

Because the Debian security team backports patches to software without
upgrading to a newer point release, the banner version says 2.4.25
despite containing fixes for these CVEs.

Please consult Debian's security tracker at
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/apache2
for documentation that the version we are running contains patches
for the CVEs mentioned. (Refer to the links under "Resolved issues".)

Thanks,
