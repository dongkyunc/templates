Hi ISP,

Thank you for the report. We believe this is a false positive.

The host in question runs Debian stable ("stretch") and has installed
the apache2 package at version {version}.

Because the Debian security team backports patches to software without
upgrading to a newer point release, the banner version says 2.4.25
despite containing fixes for these CVEs.

Here is documentation from Debian indicating that the version we are
running contains patches for the CVEs mentioned:

https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-{cve2}

Thanks,
