Hi Hostmaster,

Could you please drop the following records from the DNS:

{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU IN A 169.229.226.23
{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU IN AAAA 2607:f140:8801::1:23

and add the following records:

{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU IN A 169.229.226.49 (single A, no PTR)
{hostname}.Berkeley.EDU IN AAAA 2607:f140:8801::1:49 (single AAAA, no PTR)

Thanks!
