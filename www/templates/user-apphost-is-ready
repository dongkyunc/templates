Great, we've configured app hosting.

You can log in to the apphost server (apphost.ocf.berkeley.edu) via
SSH with the same username and password.

Your temporary URL is:

https://{fqdn_with_dashes}.apphost.ocf.berkeley.edu/

Once you've set up your new website, let us know and we will switch
{fqdn} to point to the new app-hosted one.

You can find documentation on our website: https://ocf.io/apphost

Let us know if you have any questions.
