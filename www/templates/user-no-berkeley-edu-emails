We can't provide @berkeley.edu emails (those are controlled by campus).

If you're interested, we could provide virtual hosting instead. This
is a service we provide to many student groups that gives a website
(something like <yourgroup>.berkeley.edu) and as many email forwarding
addresses @<yourgroup>.berkeley.edu as you'd like (you can create them
for club members, officers, etc.). This is open to all RSOs. We can also
provide just mail hosting (without a website) if you prefer.

If you're only interested in an @berkeley.edu email, you'll want to ask any
university faculty or staff member to go to https://idc.berkeley.edu/spa/ and
create a Special Purpose Account (SPA) for your group following the
instructions found on
https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa
After the account is created, ask the faculty or staff member to give the
members of your group access to log in under that shared account.
