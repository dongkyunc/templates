We can't provide @berkeley.edu emails (those are controlled by campus).

If you're interested, we could provide virtual hosting instead. This
is a service we provide to many student groups that gives a website
(something like <yourgroup>.berkeley.edu) and as many email forwarding
addresses @<yourgroup>.berkeley.edu as you'd like (you can create them
for club members, officers, etc.). This is open to all RSOs. We can also
provide just mail hosting (without a website) if you prefer.

If you're only interested in an @berkeley.edu email, you'll need to work with
the university to get one. They call these "Special Purpose Accounts" (SPAs).
The process requires you to have a faculty or staff member create a new SPA at
https://idc.berkeley.edu/spa/ for you and then share the account with members
of your group. The university provides instructions for that at
https://calnetweb.berkeley.edu/calnet-departments/special-purpose-accounts-spa
