If you would like to host with another service (like Weebly), you would
either need to stop using the {group}.berkeley.edu name (e.g. use
{group}.weebly.com or similar), or request off-site virtual hosting
from the university, per directions at https://offsitehosting.berkeley.edu.

In general, the university does not like for berkeley.edu sites to be
hosted off-campus, so these requests must be justified. If you go this
route, OCF would not be involved, and you would need to contact the
university directly. I do not know if these requests are often approved.
