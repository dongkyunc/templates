On {date}, the OCF Board of Directors voted to permanently disable your
account, {username}, and revoke all conferred privileges to use OCF services,
including access to the OCF computer lab, as per OCF account policy [1].

You are entitled to appeal the ban by attending in person a Board of Directors
meeting [2], where you may hear a justification from the Board, offer an
argument in your defense, and request a vote to reinstate your OCF privileges.

You may appeal one time only, and appeal is the ONLY option to have your
privileges and account restored. Coming to the lab, messaging OCF volunteer or
front desk staff, or complaining to other parties will not lead to the return
of your account privileges; it may even harm your appeal if this behavior is
perceived as harassment.
