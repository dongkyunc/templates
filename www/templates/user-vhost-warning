Dear {group}:

The OCF staff noticed that your group's website [1] does not have either
the "Hosted by OCF" banner [2] or University disclaimer [3] required by OCF
and university virtual hosting rules. All student group websites are
required to display the "Hosted by OCF" banner as well as the student group
disclaimer. Unfortunately, if you do not add both of them, we may be forced
to temporarily disable your website to comply with the OCF's and
university's requirements. Please add both sometime within the next 2 weeks
to prevent disabling of your website.

Your username is "{username}".

If you've forgotten how to login, instructions can be found here [4]. If
you've forgotten your password, you can reset it here [5].

Feel free to reply all to this email if you have any questions or if we can
help with making the change! Please include help@ocf.berkeley.edu if you
would like a response.
