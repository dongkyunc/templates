Hi {user},

The OCF, which hosts your website {fqdn} is upgrading its app hosting
infrastructure from Debian jessie to Debian stretch!

The upgrade will happen by moving the currently running apps from the existing
server (named werewolves) to a new server (named vampires).  You can already
connect to the new server by using SSH and connecting to
"vampires.ocf.berkeley.edu".

Right now, your app is only running on werewolves. We need your help to get it
moved over to vampires so that we can complete the transition to the latest
Debian version.

The versions for nearly all software installed on the system will be changing,
which is why the migration cannot be done in a more automatic way. Some notable
changes include:

    - Ruby 2.1.5     -> Ruby 2.3.3
    - Python 3.4.2   -> Python 3.5.3
    - Python 2.7.9   -> Python 2.7.13
    - NodeJS 0.10.29 -> NodeJS 4.8.2
    - PHP 5.6.36     -> PHP 7.0.30

Because binaries for programs like Ruby, Python, and NodeJS are dynamically
linked, if you have a copy of these programs in your home directory (which is
what programs like virtualenv, nvm, and rvm do), there is a good chance they
won't work on the new server.

In most cases, it is necessary to rebuild your environment (such as recreating
a virtualenv on the new system or reinstalling Ruby/Node using rvm/nvm).

We'd like to help you make the upgrade without downtime. The way we recommend
this is:


1. Log in to vampires and create a *copy* of your entire apps folder.  It won't
   work to make a copy of the directory inside apps, you need to copy the
   entire folder.

   For example:

       {user}@vampires:~$ cp -r apps apps-stretch

   It's necessary to create a *new* apps folder because otherwise the systemd
   process running on werewolves, the old app server, will try to launch your
   new copy of the app as well and the copy of your existing app might not
   work, causing downtime for your website.


2. On vampires, cd into the new folder and try executing the run script:

       {user}@vampires:~$ cd apps-stretch/myapp
       {user}@vampires:~/apps-stretch/myapp$ ./run

   Hopefully it'll either work, or you'll see a helpful error. If it works, you
   can test your site at this URL to ensure it behaves as you'd expect:

   https://{fqdn_with_dashes}.dev-apphost.ocf.berkeley.edu/

   If you see errors, you'll have to determine how to resolve them. The
   documentation on our website might be useful:
   https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/webapps/

   You can also ask for our help by replying to this email, we'd be happy to
   help you with the migration.


3. Copy the existing systemd service file to make a new service for the new
   version of your app:

       {user}@vampires:~$ cd ~/.config/systemd/user
       {user}@vampires:~/.config/systemd/user$ cp myapp.service myapp-stretch.service

   Then edit the systemd service file (myapp-stretch.service) and replace the
   line that says:

       ConditionHost=werewolves

   with a line containing:

       ConditionHost=vampires

   so that your new version of your app will run only on the new server. Then,
   enable your service so that it starts when the apphosting machine boots, and
   start it up:

       {user}@vampires:~$ systemctl --user daemon-reload
       {user}@vampires:~$ systemctl --user enable myapp-stretch.service
       {user}@vampires:~$ systemctl --user start myapp-stretch.service

   Our docs on apphost supervising might also be helpful here if you run into
   any issues: https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/webapps/#supervise

   If you need any help here, also feel free to ask. We have a lot of
   experience troubleshooting systemd service issues and we'd be happy to help
   if you encounter any troubles.


4. Once you've ironed out all the kinks in your app, reply to this email to let
   us know you've upgraded. We'll switch over to the new server according to
   the schedule listed below and your new app version will be switched over to
   run under your domain as part of the process. You should leave the old
   version of the app running on werewolves until the switch in servers is made
   on {upgrade_date} to avoid any downtime.


Please respond as soon as possible and confirm you're working on this.  If
you'd like us to attempt to upgrade the site for you, we're happy to do that;
just let us know.

The timeline for this move looks like:

- Today ({today}):
  Notify groups about apphosting server move

- {response_deadline}:
  Deadline to respond. We need to hear from you by this date, even if it's just
  "we're working on it". If we don't hear from you, we will assume you want us
  to attempt to upgrade your site for you.

- {upgrade_date}:
  Deadline to upgrade. The old server will be gone after this date, the new
  server will be switched into its place, and your domain served.

If you think you need more time to make the upgrade or have any questions,
please let us know as soon as you can. To contact us, please either reply to
this email or come to one of our staff hours (https://ocf.io/staff-hours) to
talk about the migration with a friendly OCF staff member!

Thanks!
